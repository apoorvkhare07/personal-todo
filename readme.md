# Personal TODO

Simple todo application using React. You can run it locally on your computer or a working demo is at https://apoorvkhare07.github.io/personal-todo.

### Features

 A to-do list is a common app idea, but without having a database to store the to-dos, it's not particularly useful.
 However, even without any sort of database, we can use the local storage built into a web browser to save to-do items. This could be actually useful for taking quick notes. Set the app as your "new tab" page in your browser and the to-dos will persist on your local as long as you don't clear the cache.

 This will also keep your data safe as it will only be in your local.
